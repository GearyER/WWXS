\subsection{Web API Communication Protocol}
The goal of these API calls is to create, read, update and delete entries safley in the database. And to clearly communicate with the client (usually the web UI or the Mobile Application) the API must give meaningful responses. Any form of response designed to not return data will reply with JSON data with a message field. For example, a 200 "OK" response would return with this message in the body:
\begin{lstlisting}
  {
    message: "OK"
  }
\end{lstlisting}
In general, here are a list of create, read, update and delete calls and what they should return:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| p{0.2\linewidth} | p{0.4\linewidth}  | p{0.4\linewidth} |}
    \hline
    HTTP Request Type & On success & On failure \\
    \hline
    GET "/" & 200 and all entries in the table & 400 Bad Request \\
    \hline
    GET "/:id" & 200 all entries in the table & 400 Bad Request \\
    & whose private key matches & 404 Not Found \\
    \hline
    POST "/" & 201 and the entry placed in the table & 400 Bad Request \\
    \hline
    PUT "/:id" & 200 and the entire entry updated & 400 Bad Request \\
    & with updated information & 404 Not Found \\
    \hline
    DELETE "/:id" & 200 OK & 400 Bad Request \\
    & & 404 Not Found \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
And the routes:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{| p{0.2\linewidth} | p{0.4\linewidth}  | p{0.4\linewidth} |}
    \hline
    Route & Description & Supported Methods \\
    \hline
    /buoy & Information associated with every buoy. & GET, GET + /:id, POST, PUT, DELETE + /:id \\
    \hline
    /data & Information associated with data pointed collected by buoys. & GET, GET + /:id, POST \\
    \hline
    /group & Information associated with groups of users. & GET, GET + /:id, POST, PUT, DELETE + /:id \\
    \hline
    /session & \emph{Deprecated} Information associated with user sessions. & \emph{Deprecated} \\
    \hline
    /user & Information associated with users and login. & GET, GET + /:id, POST \\
    \hline
    /user/login & Returns web token for authorization. & POST \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
