\section{Basic User Guide}
% Very brief purpose statement for the user guide
The WWXS offers a unique way of keeping students engaged beyond the end of their camp. The buoy will allow for physical interaction with a device that creates useful data. With a higher level of user interaction students will be more likely to retain the skills they have learned at the Sea Discovery Camp. This user guide will give a brief operation overview of the entire system.
